LEAVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - USER GUIDE (AI-ENHANCED)
==================================================

This document explains how the leave management system works in simple terms.
The system now supports both traditional forms AND natural language processing!

NEW AI-ENHANCED COMMANDS
========================

1. APPLYING FOR LEAVE - TWO WAYS!
   ------------------------------
   
   Traditional Way (Form):
   Type: `/apply-leave`
   - Opens a form to fill out
   - Shows your current balance
   - Select dates, type, reason, etc.
   
   NEW AI Way (Natural Language):
   Type: `/apply-leave I need 2 days off next week for vacation`
   - AI understands your request in plain English
   - Automatically extracts dates, leave type, duration
   - Creates the request directly
   
   Examples of AI requests:
   â€¢ `/apply-leave I'm sick tomorrow, need leave`
   â€¢ `/apply-leave Taking 3 casual days from Monday to Wednesday`
   â€¢ `/apply-leave Need maternity leave starting March 15th`
   â€¢ `/apply-leave Emergency - family issue, need Friday off`

2. CHECKING LEAVE BALANCE - TWO WAYS!
   ---------------------------------
   
   Traditional Way:
   Type: `/leave-balance`
   - Shows standard balance breakdown
   
   NEW AI Way:
   Type: `/leave-balance how many sick days do I have left?`
   Type: `/leave-balance when does my casual leave reset?`
   - AI answers specific questions about your balance
   - Gives personalized explanations

3. VIEWING LEAVE HISTORY - TWO WAYS!
   --------------------------------
   
   Traditional Way:
   Type: `/my-leaves`
   - Shows list of all your leave requests
   
   NEW AI Way:
   Type: `/my-leaves what leaves did I take last month?`
   Type: `/my-leaves show me my approved sick leaves`
   - AI filters and explains your history based on your question

HOW THE AI WORKS
================

SMART UNDERSTANDING:
- "tomorrow" â†’ AI calculates the actual date
- "next week" â†’ AI suggests Monday-Friday of next week  
- "couple of days" â†’ AI understands as 2-3 days
- "sick" â†’ AI knows you want sick leave
- "vacation" â†’ AI knows you want casual leave

CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
- High confidence (75%+): AI submits request automatically
- Medium confidence (50-74%): AI asks for confirmation
- Low confidence (<50%): AI opens the regular form

LEAVE TYPES RECOGNIZED:
- "sick", "ill", "medical" â†’ SICK LEAVE
- "vacation", "holiday", "personal" â†’ CASUAL LEAVE  
- "maternity", "baby", "pregnancy" â†’ MATERNITY LEAVE
- "paternity", "birth", "father" â†’ PATERNITY LEAVE

BENEFITS OF AI ENHANCEMENT
==========================

FASTER: Instead of clicking through forms, just tell the AI what you want
SMARTER: AI understands context and dates automatically
FRIENDLIER: Get conversational responses instead of system messages
FLEXIBLE: Both AI and traditional methods work - use what you prefer!

EXISTING FEATURES (UNCHANGED)
=============================

All your familiar features still work exactly the same:

âœ… Different leave types (Casual, Sick, Maternity, Paternity)
âœ… Manager approval workflows  
âœ… Document upload requirements
âœ… Conflict detection (department and team conflicts)
âœ… Balance tracking and monthly resets
âœ… Team management commands
âœ… Department selection
âœ… Leave policy information

EXAMPLES OF AI USAGE
===================

SCENARIO 1: Quick Sick Leave
User: `/apply-leave I'm not feeling well, need tomorrow off`
AI: "ðŸ¤– Got it! I've submitted your sick leave request for tomorrow. Your manager will review it soon!"

SCENARIO 2: Vacation Planning
User: `/apply-leave Need 5 days vacation from June 10-14 for family trip`
AI: "ðŸ¤– Perfect! I've requested 5 casual days for your family trip. I noticed you'll have 3 days remaining balance after this."

The AI enhancement makes the leave system faster and more conversational while keeping all existing functionality!
