Now i used the same old code of team calendar that works with the forms alone i need u to provide code where i can also use the ai to process this command like
'/team-calendar ..text..', this text is given to the ai and get the outputn in json , use those value (watever value provided and if not got keep things optional ) and fetch data from db using given info in the same way as done currently in the team calendar code .Every code related to team calendar is there in teh file calendar_handler.py and the command is called at the views.py inside the folder leave under leave_application folder ,Use #codebase .Make sure u handle the timeout error which can be solved by sending response first and the processing the main at background and then sending it .This problem is already solved in the apply-leave command .Make sure u dont affect any existing working code in those files .
