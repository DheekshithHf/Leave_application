AI-ENHANCED LEAVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
===================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The leave management system now includes AI-powered natural language processing to make requesting leaves as easy as having a conversation with a friend!

NEW AI FEATURES
===============

1. NATURAL LANGUAGE LEAVE REQUESTS (/ai-leave)
   ----------------------------------------
   Instead of filling forms, just tell the AI what you want:
   
   Examples:
   ‚Ä¢ "I need 3 days off next week for vacation"
   ‚Ä¢ "I'm sick tomorrow, need leave"
   ‚Ä¢ "Taking maternity leave starting March 15th"
   ‚Ä¢ "Need 2 casual days off for wedding on Friday and Monday"
   
   What happens:
   - AI understands your request in plain English
   - Extracts: leave type, dates, duration, reason
   - Shows you what it understood for confirmation
   - You can approve, edit, or cancel before submitting

2. AI CHAT ASSISTANT (/ask-ai)
   -------------------------
   Ask questions about leave policies and procedures:
   
   Examples:
   ‚Ä¢ "How many sick days do I have left?"
   ‚Ä¢ "What's the company's maternity leave policy?"
   ‚Ä¢ "Can I take leave on short notice?"
   ‚Ä¢ "What documents do I need for sick leave?"
   
   The AI provides friendly, helpful answers in conversational language.

3. ENHANCED MANAGER NOTIFICATIONS
   ----------------------------
   Managers now receive AI-generated summaries that:
   - Highlight important information clearly
   - Use friendly, professional language
   - Include smart recommendations
   - Make conflict information easy to understand

EXAMPLE CONVERSATIONS
====================

USER: "/ai-leave I'm feeling sick and need tomorrow off"

AI: "ü§ñ Got it! You need sick leave for tomorrow. Let me help you submit this request!

*Here's what I understood:*
‚Ä¢ Leave Type: SICK
‚Ä¢ Duration: 1 day
‚Ä¢ Start Date: 2024-01-16
‚Ä¢ End Date: 2024-01-16
‚Ä¢ Reason: Feeling sick
‚Ä¢ Backup Person: None

[‚úÖ Submit This Request] [‚úèÔ∏è Edit Details] [‚ùå Cancel]"

USER: "/ask-ai What happens if I don't have enough casual leave days?"

AI: "ü§ñ Great question! If you don't have enough casual leave days, don't worry - your request will still go to your manager for review. They have a few options:

‚Ä¢ Approve it as unpaid leave
‚Ä¢ Approve it with compensatory work (you work extra days later)
‚Ä¢ Approve it anyway (manager's discretion)

Your request won't be automatically rejected due to insufficient balance. The system is designed to be flexible and human-centered! üòä"

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

AI NOT UNDERSTANDING:
- Try rephrasing more clearly
- Include specific dates when possible
- Use the regular form (/apply-leave) as backup

LOW CONFIDENCE RESPONSES:
- AI will ask for clarification
- Provide missing information
- Or switch to regular form

TECHNICAL ISSUES:
- All regular commands still work
- AI features are additional, not replacement
- Contact support if persistent issues

The AI integration makes the leave management system more intuitive and user-friendly while maintaining all existing functionality and security!
