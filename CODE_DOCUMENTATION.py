WORKFLOW SUMMARY BY LEAVE TYPE:
===============================

CASUAL LEAVE:
- Shows balance warning if insufficient
- Manager options: [Approve|Unpaid|Compensatory|Reject]
- If Compensatory: Employee chooses date â†’ Manager thread update

SICK LEAVE:
- Checks if >1 day OR insufficient balance
- If yes: Shows medical certificate recommendation
- Manager options: [Approve|Request Medical Cert|Reject]
- Document workflow: [Upload Now|Submit Later|Cancel]

MATERNITY LEAVE:
- Shows count info (1st/2nd = 182 days, 3rd+ = 84 days)
- Always shows medical certificate requirement
- Same document workflow as sick leave

PATERNITY LEAVE:
- Shows count info (always 16 days per occurrence)
- Always shows birth certificate requirement
- Same document workflow as sick leave

CONFLICT DETECTION (ALL TYPES):
- Employee conflicts (across all departments)
- Department conflicts (same department)
- Team conflicts (team members) - NEWLY ADDED
- Shows detailed date ranges and employee names

TEAM CONFLICTS FEATURE:
======================
Location: leave_utils.py - get_team_conflicts()
Integration: modal_handlers.py - line ~150

What it does:
1. Finds all teams the requesting user belongs to
2. Checks for any team members on leave during requested dates
3. Shows team name and detailed date ranges
4. Displays both approved and pending leaves

Example output in manager notification:
ðŸ‘¥ *Team Conflicts:*
ðŸ”¸ *Team: Frontend Development*
  â€¢ Approved (1): <@john.doe> - 2024-01-15 to 2024-01-17
  â€¢ Pending (1): <@jane.smith> - 2024-01-16

IMPORTANT FILES FOR FUTURE MODIFICATIONS:
=========================================

- TO CHANGE LEAVE WORKFLOWS: modal_handlers.py (line 30-400)
- TO MODIFY MANAGER ACTIONS: block_action_handlers.py
- TO UPDATE BALANCE LOGIC: leave_utils.py (get_leave_balance)
- TO CHANGE CONFLICT DETECTION: leave_utils.py (get_*_conflicts functions)
- TO MODIFY SLASH COMMANDS: command_handlers.py
- TO UPDATE FORM DISPLAY: command_handlers.py (handle_apply_leave)

DO NOT MODIFY:
- The core workflow structure is working correctly
- Thread management logic in slack_utils.py
- Database models in models.py (unless adding new fields)
- URL routing in urls.py

TESTING CHECKLIST:
==================
1. âœ… Submit casual leave with insufficient balance â†’ Reaches managers with warning
2. âœ… Manager clicks 'Compensatory Work' â†’ User gets notification in leave_app
3. âœ… User selects compensation date â†’ Manager sees response in thread
4. âœ… Submit sick leave >1 day â†’ Manager gets medical cert option
5. âœ… Submit maternity/paternity â†’ Shows correct count info
6. âœ… All requests show department, employee, and team conflicts
7. âœ… Text formatting appears correctly in Slack (no ** showing)
