LEAVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - USER GUIDE
=====================================

This document explains how the leave management system works in simple terms.

WHAT IS THIS SYSTEM?
===================

This is a Slack-based leave management system that helps employees request time off and managers approve or reject those requests. Everything happens through Slack commands and messages.

- MANAGERS: Can approve/reject leave requests, request documents, view team calendars
- ADMINS: Can manage departments and teams
